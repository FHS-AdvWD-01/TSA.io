          The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national student organization created to develop skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as well as business education.
          In TSA they compete against other high schools in New Jersey with the work that they have created.

        <p>
          Meetings occur once a month. As of January 2020 meeting will start to be once every other week.
